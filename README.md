# ENPM661 Project 4 - Way Points with Baxter in Gazebo

Justin Albrecht & Brian Bock

This project is a simple simulation of a pick and place task by a Baxter robot. The simulation runs in Gazebo and utilizes RViz for way points. 

This project code is based on the Baxter demo pick and place code, with a modified environment and commands. The simulation runs in Gazebo 7 on Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic.  

## Why we need waypoints?
